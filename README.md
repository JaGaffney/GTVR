## Teacher VR (prev Great Teacher VR) ##
---------------------
A VR teaching website created with React and Django to help teachers control their classroom VR experiences. Designed in collaboration with a Master's student teaching at Kangan University in order to solve their current teaching needs.
One of the main areas of development on this project was creating working VR cross platform inside a web browser. Each browser and OS handles VR movement differently which ended with me having to create a custom interface to handle the VR aspects. As well as compromising on the project specifications and having IOS safari open inside the YouTube rather than inside the browser due to IOS retractions which the client understood.

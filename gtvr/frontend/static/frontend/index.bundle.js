In our case a deficit existed between many of our students in terms of life experience, age, exposure to the globalised landscape and socio-cultural experiences of independence. While some of these students were easily able to converse and relate to a variety of topics, often students had not had a great deal of exposure to the topics that were referred to in the curriculum.

One way to address discomfort is to provide a variety of headset options, including hand-held goggles as opposed to fastened goggles to enable better control of their experience."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"At an institutional level, VR will continue to be used as more and more texts are sourced and mapped effectively to our curriculum. Due to the success of the research, our department has purchased a full class set of VR goggles, and teachers will be encouraged and trained to use them in class to enhance the learner experience. Some areas we aim to further examine are using VR to provide a basis for fluency speaking practice in tandem with coursebook material. Morrison (2016) conducted research using VR and concluded that it could be used to increase motivation and engagement generally amongst learners. As mentioned in our findings, we definitely found that VR had a positive effect on engaging students, particularly as their mobile phone usage was restricted. As Morrison has alluded to, conducting practice exercises using VR could potentially be an outcome of the technology’s increasing use."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Considering other future possibilities, entrepreneurs such as Cardwell (2018) have attempted to produce dedicated VR applications that include interactivity with a VR text and provide instant feedback to students on their abilities.

As the research of VR in English language learning is still in its infancy, we believe that further exploration by others in different contexts would be beneficial to understanding its effectiveness in the classroom.

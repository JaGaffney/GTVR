                <h3>Context and focus</h3>
                <p>
                    Kangan Institute’s English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas
                    Students (ELICOS) offer four General English levels and cater to
                    students from a variety of backgrounds and age groups. Our action
                    research (AR) focused on the upper intermediate level, which gives
                    students an IELTS equivalent of approximately 5.5 upon completion.
                    ELICOS students are either studying English only, or preparing to
                    enter a Certificate or Diploma course following completion of upper
                    intermediate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The main focus of the research first came to light due to a noticeable
                    issue occurring in discussion tasks and summative assessments. Many
                    students were often unable to participate or contribute fluently in
                    discussions, particularly if they were personally unfamiliar with the
                    topic. As Reyes and Vallone (2007:59) note, authentic assessment
                    should create equity between learners with ‘activities that foreground
                    the linguistic and cultural backgrounds of students’. In our case a
                    deficit existed between many of our students in terms of life
                    experience, age, exposure to the globalised landscape and
                    socio-cultural experiences of independence. While some of these
                    students were easily able to converse and relate to a variety of
                    topics, often students had not had a great deal of exposure to the
                    topics that were referred to in the curriculum. This phenomenon had
                    been observed for some time, with research arguing that students can
                    lack the ability to connect through appropriate and meaningful
                    dialogue with others (Yates and Wahid 2013:1,038).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This issue creates a unique problem for ELICOS providers in general.
                    General English programs strive to deliver well-rounded courses that
                    cover global themes, whilst simultaneously considering the broad range
                    of cultural and social experiences in the classroom. In terms of
                    speaking assessments and discussions, this problem leads teachers to
                    change topics and questions to best cater for their group of students.
                    However, providing flexibility to students offers a short-term
                    solution in many cases, and presented a challenge in ensuring the
                    fairness and consistency of assessment tasks between groups of
                    students and periods of time.
                </p>

                <h3>Research questions</h3>
                <p>
                    The issue discussed above led us to consider a variety of approaches.
                    One of the possibilities involved using technology as a way of
                    bridging the experience gap between students. We decided to experiment
                    by introducing virtual reality (VR) into the classroom. VR is the use
                    of 360° video content, which is viewed through a headset and tracks
                    with the user’s head movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the initial stages of the proposal, exact research questions were
                    not apparent. We believed, however, that VR might perhaps help
                    students connect to a topic more easily. This was because we
                    experimented with the video and technology ourselves and found the
                    experience more immersive than traditional video. We also hoped that
                    they might be able to produce more interesting, complex content and
                    ideas, though there was no observable way of defining content as such.
                    Later, we decided that the most accurate measurement tool would be the
                    performance indicators available in our discussion rubric (Appendix
                    1), which we could use to compare changes in the students’ ability to
                    express themselves over a number of research cycles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two key research questions (RQs) gradually came into focus:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            1. Does interaction with a VR text assist in the production of
                            more personalised ideas and content?
                        </li>
                        <li>2. How do students respond to the use of VR texts?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    RQ1 attempted to address the key issue of students being unable to
                    relate personally to an abstract concept, or a concept with which they
                    have had no personal connection or experience. For example, if
                    students were asked to discuss crime, students who experienced crime,
                    or have family and friends who experienced it, were much more likely
                    to engage with the topic. Through the use of VR, the aim was to
                    provide a virtual space in which students would all have had the same
                    experience, and one that most closely related to the subject matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RQ2 was deliberately broader and aimed to capture some of the
                    first-hand user experiences that students had while using the
                    technology. These responses may have involved physical experiences and
                    sensations, emotional responses, cultural and social reactions, and
                    most notably the intellectual stimulation that we hoped would be
                    facilitated through the VR text.
                </p>

                <h3>Intervention procedure</h3>
                <p>
                    Our research consisted of two cycles within the upper intermediate
                    class, with five students participating in both cycles. We chose this
                    level as we believed it would make the instruction and feedback
                    process much more efficient to manage and student responses would be
                    more detailed. The first cycle had 12 students and the second had 15
                    students. They originated from China, Indonesia, South Korea, Japan,
                    Colombia and Thailand. The students’ ages ranged between 18 and 30,
                    with an English proficiency level between Common European Framework of
                    Reference (CEFR, Council of Europe 2001) Levels B1 and B2. After
                    conducting a pre-intervention survey, we collated data on their
                    initial experiences and opinions with technology and preparation for
                    discussion assessments. Every participant stated that they felt
                    comfortable using new technology in class, with most of them stating
                    that they found mobile phones, video and iPads useful or very useful.
                    This was an important finding, particularly as we would be undertaking
                    the project with technology that we felt hadn’t been used much in the
                    classroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of our own experience with VR in the classroom, neither of us
                    had had much experience sourcing content or using the technology in
                    this way before the project. However, we both considered ourselves
                    capable of learning to use new technology, so discovering how to use
                    the VR goggles was not a major obstacle in the process. Joseph was a
                    regular teacher in the upper intermediate class and undertook the
                    first cycle with the students. This ensured that they were comfortable
                    not only in the discussion itself, but also the focus group. The
                    second cycle was run by James, who had not taught this particular
                    class before the intervention. We conducted the lessons approximately
                    10 weeks apart, so therefore most of the cohort had changed in the
                    second cycle. However, we were able to have some students in both
                    groups – providing a basis for comparison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The students engaged in lessons with and without VR, with the former
                    followed by a discussion that prompted a response to the experience
                    they had viewed. For the purpose of the research, VR headsets were
                    purchased and students made use of their personal phones to display
                    the content. Initial research into media sources involved applications
                    that displayed images with sound and made use of Google’s Street View.
                    We settled on using the mobile YouTube application as our primary
                    platform, as using the search function to filter 360° VR-supported
                    videos was rather intuitive and this also meant that content creation
                    was not required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the curriculum was based on the first edition of the coursebook
                    (Clare and Wilson 2011), VR content was selected to match the
                    corresponding unit themes. In the first cycle, we used Unit 8.1, ‘It’s
                    a Tough Call’, which contextualises language around making difficult
                    decisions in stressful situations. In a non-VR discussion, students
                    would typically need to recall a difficult situation they had
                    experienced and establish a discussion around this theme. However, for
                    the VR alternative, a video entitled ‘Decisions: A 360° virtual
                    reality drunk driving experience, presented by Johnnie Walker’ was
                    used for students to discuss. This text showed a young woman
                    experiencing the consequences of drink-driving from a variety of
                    perspectives. We provided conventional pre-teaching, followed by
                    participation in the VR experience in small groups (Appendix 2). The
                    students were then given questions, which would be the basis for their
                    ensuing discussion, before watching the video a second time. Questions
                    involved asking students to say how they felt, give their opinions on
                    what the people in the video could have done differently, and provide
                    personalised answers.
                </p>

                <h3>Data collection</h3>
                <p>
                    Data collection involved four principal sources covering both
                    quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative sources were the
                    student discussion assessment results, which compared the VR and
                    non-VR results, and a survey which was primarily used to capture
                    students’ existing perspectives and attitudes to VR in an educational
                    context. The qualitative sources were made up of a focus group
                    interview, which came after the student discussion assessment, and a
                    textual analysis of the language used by students during the VR-based
                    discussion. The organisation of data sources was designed to
                    facilitate a thorough analysis of the use of VR in the classroom
                    through a triangulated range of data sets.
                </p>
                <h3>Findings</h3>
                <p>
                    With the variety of data sources at our disposal, we were able to make
                    a number of findings in order to answer our two RQs. With the two sets
                    of scores, we were also able to determine whether any patterns could
                    be made between the groups. To gain further insight, we used the
                    discourse analysis to measure the quality of the students’ responses.
                    We were able to use the assessment scores and discourse analysis to
                    see the use of personalised language and effectiveness and level of
                    collaboration between students. The focus group interview gave us
                    varied responses from students, and we were ultimately able to
                    identify some common thematic responses. The students expressed their
                    enjoyment of VR, but some of them felt uncomfortable using the
                    goggles.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. Students utilised more personalised language</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many students were able to produce more personalised language
                    throughout their discussion. This finding was demonstrated through
                    both discourse analysis and by comparing individual students’ content
                    scores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the discourse analysis of one discussion, we counted the number of
                    ‘I felt/feel…’ statements (15) and personal stories (2) (see Appendix
                    3). When recounting a personal story, one student said: ‘That’s
                    exactly the same as my cousin lost all the movement in his arm.’
                    Additional evidence showed students’ content scores in comparison with
                    a non-VR discussion, which saw a median increase of 10% (see Appendix
                    4). As predicted, younger students with less life experience saw the
                    greatest benefit. One example is Student A (21 years old), whose
                    content score rose from 3 to 4.5 and overall score increased from 48%
                    to 74%. In contrast, the inverse can be seen in Student B (27 years
                    old) whose content and overall score showed no change (see Figure 1).
                    Student B’s result reflects his
                </p>

                <img

                                alt="sample-score-contract figure 1"
                            />

                <p>
                    <strong>2. VR facilitated authentic collaborative learning</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once again, both the discourse analysis and student scores indicated
                    that students found it easier to conduct an authentic discussion as a
                    team after using VR. When students were engaged in an assessed
                    discussion, they often found it difficult to ‘act authentically’. This
                    could result in a lack of natural turn-taking and active listening as
                    well as long monologues. The difference noted in the discourse
                    analysis was demonstrated by several key elements: interruptions,
                    agreement/ disagreement, clarification, questions and affirmations.
                    All of these elements were seen frequently in the discussion, which we
                    believed indicated a natural reaction to the experience. One example
                    of this language use was seen in an excerpt in the first round of
                    discussions (see Appendix 5). In addition, there was also a 13% median
                    assessment results increase (non-VR >VR) in the teamwork and
                    participation performance indicator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3. Students found the texts to be more engaging</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, students found that VR texts were engaging and allowed them
                    to connect more deeply with the topic. Throughout the research,
                    students responded positively to the ‘real-life’ experience. An 8%
                    median increase was seen in the engaging and responding performance
                    indicator. Improvements are also evident in the discourse analysis,
                    which created a more authentic discussion, and the focus groups, which
                    allowed the students to provide feedback about their experience. Some
                    comments included (comments are unedited to maintain authenticity): ‘
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                    This finding is further supported in a study by educator Ida Mae
                    Craddock (2018:8), who found that using engaging content can lead to
                    increased student attention. Furthermore, her research showed that the
                    use of an engaging visual aid such as a VR text can efficiently allow
                    English language learners to grasp concepts without comprehending all
                    the vocabulary in the text. As our goal was to create stronger
                    connections to content, it is likely that the use of engaging visual
                    resources in our AR assisted in this process.

                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the process, we had to direct students and give careful
                    instructions on how to use the headsets effectively. At times,
                    students would remove headsets prematurely or be at very different
                    stages of the video. Some students who felt motion sickness were
                    instead encouraged to use their phones without the headsets, although
                    it seemed that this did not create a particularly immersive experience
                    for them. Overall, most students happily participated with only a few
                    having technical issues; some made it clear that VR was not suitable
                    for them due to a past poor experience. It would seem that students
                    need to be made fully aware of how they may feel after using VR,
                    considering that motion sickness can impact their involvement in the
                    discussion. Recent developments in VR have been attempting to tackle
                    the issue of motion sickness with the development of a scale (Kim,
                    Park, Choi and Choe 2018:72). Ideally, it would be possible for
                    teachers to use a motion sickness scale to be better informed for
                    video selection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the negative side effects that were occasionally encountered by
                    students, we also concluded that using VR in an assessment may not be
                    the best way to exploit its capabilities in the class. Therefore,
                    whilst assessments provided a clear tool to measure its effectiveness
                    and to ensure fairness in students’ assessments, VR could be better
                    utilised in lessons leading up to discussions as opposed to forming
                    the basis of an assessment. In particular, VR could be used to further
                    connect students to topics that may appear distant to them due to
                    differences in life experience and culture. A practical example could
                    be the use of VR to engage students by immersing them in an experience
                    of a community affected by climate change or extreme poverty. This
                    would usually be difficult to personalise for some students, and VR
                    may be used to bridge the gap in empathy and understanding of these
                    topics.

                    <strong>5. Post-research findings</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the successful AR referred to in this report, we purchased
                    additional VR goggles to allow for simultaneous whole-class
                    experiences. We subsequently engaged a whole class of 18 students at
                    pre-intermediate level (A1–A2) in the VR experience. There were some
                    difficulties encountered in this lesson, particularly around teaching
                    students how to activate the VR feature in the YouTube application.
                    This caused the students to experience the video in a scattered way,
                    somewhat affecting the overall experience. From this, we believe that
                    setting aside time to cover the use of the goggles and the YouTube
                    application may be necessary to make VR usage more streamlined at
                    lower levels.
                </p>

                <h3>Reflections and conclusions</h3>
                <p>
                    From our research, we concluded that VR functions effectively as a way
                    for students to increase engagement with texts. Indeed, we predicted
                    that VR could be an effective medium for contextualising language at
                    all levels, and is an effective means of eliciting prior knowledge.
                    Furthermore, as the technology develops, teachers and students will
                    find it possible to create videos. This in turn may allow students to
                    engage both as creators as well as consumers of VR content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As predicted from the outset, students who were generally younger and
                    had less exposure to social and cultural experiences found the
                    greatest benefit from the VR content. In addition, most students found
                    VR engaging, regardless of age, experience or cultural background. In
                    contrast, the discomfort some students felt is something that will
                    need to be mitigated in the future. Teachers will need to proactively
                    ensure those students are not disadvantaged in their learning
                    experiences. One way to address discomfort is to provide a variety of
                    headset options, including hand-held goggles as opposed to fastened
                    goggles to enable better control of their experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At an institutional level, VR will continue to be used as more and
                    more texts are sourced and mapped effectively to our curriculum. Due
                    to the success of the research, our department has purchased a full
                    class set of VR goggles, and teachers will be encouraged and trained
                    to use them in class to enhance the learner experience. Some areas we
                    aim to further examine are using VR to provide a basis for fluency
                    speaking practice in tandem with coursebook material. Morrison (2016)
                    conducted research using VR and concluded that it could be used to
                    increase motivation and engagement generally amongst learners. As
                    mentioned in our findings, we definitely found that VR had a positive
                    effect on engaging students, particularly as their mobile phone usage
                    was restricted. As Morrison has alluded to, conducting practice
                    exercises using VR could potentially be an outcome of the technology’s
                    increasing use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Considering other future possibilities, entrepreneurs such as Cardwell
                    (2018) have attempted to produce dedicated VR applications that
                    include interactivity with a VR text and provide instant feedback to
                    students on their abilities. This technology could enable learners to
                    take the experience outside of the classroom to provide an additional
                    layer of scaffolding. As the research of VR in English language
                    learning is still in its infancy, we believe that further exploration
                    by others in different contexts would be beneficial to understanding
                    its effectiveness in the classroom. AR of this kind might encourage
                    developers and publishers to move their focus to creating applications
                    with English language learners in mind.
